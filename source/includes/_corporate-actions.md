## <em>Corporate Actions üöß</em>

The Corporate Actions API allows an Investment Manager to perform Corporate Actions that relate to 
[Instruments](/#settlement-equity-instruments).

The API is currently under construction.

## Dividends 

The [`POST /corporate-actions/dividends`](/#settlement-equity-post-dividend) endpoint can be used to pay dividends 
to investors that hold shares in an instrument.
 
Said endpoint references an instrument, and takes a list of all the investors that are shareholders to be paid. 

The call to [`POST /corporate-actions/dividends`](/#settlement-equity-post-dividend) will return a 201 Created response
with a `status` field in the body of 'AWAITING FUNDS'.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this response only indicates that the dividend instruction has been received. 
The distribution of the dividend to investors will not occur until the necessary funds are received. 

The response will include a payTo section. Payment should be sent to the bank details specified, including the `payTo.reference`.

Once payment has been made, the [`GET /corporate-actions/dividends/{dividendId}`](/#settlement-equity-get-dividend-by-id) 
endpoint can be used to see the current status of the dividend instruction.

The status of the money transfer is further broken down at a per investor level.
