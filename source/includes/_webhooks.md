# Webhooks
Receiving webhook updates for events that take place in the Goji Platform.

## Authentication

To allow you to verify that the webhook message originated from Goji, HMAC authentication headers will be included with the request.
`x-nonce` A unique string for every request. This will also be included in the signature string (see below) and is used to prevent replay attacks.
`x-timestamp` Milliseconds since epoch. This will also be included in the signature string (see below) and is used to prevent replay attacks.
`Authorization` In the format `<signature-string>` See below for how to build the `signature-string` .

### Building the signature string

The following details are concatenated together (without spaces):

    `nonce + \n + timestamp`

Where `\n` represents a single linefeed character, hex code `0x10`.

The string is then encrypted using `HMAC-SHA256` using a secret. This secret will either be shared with you as part of the onboarding process, or is obtained from our API when registering your webhook URL.
The result is then Base64 encoded to produce a string.
The encrypted string is then UTF-8 URL encoded.

### Verifying the signature

<aside class="notice">
You should verify that the `Authorization` header matches the expected signature string using the secret that was shared with you during onboarding.
