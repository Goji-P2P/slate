## <em>Bulk Payments</em>

The Bulk Payments API allows an Investment Manager to specify a total amount of funds to distribute amongst their 
individual investors.

## Batch Payments 

The [`POST /transfers/batch`](/#payments-manager-post-transfers-batch) endpoint can be used to 
transfer money to multiple investors.

Said endpoint references a `totalPayout` amount, and takes a list of all the investors and the amount each is due to be paid.

The call to [`POST /transfers/batch`](/#payments-manager-post-transfers-batch) will return a 201 Created response
with a `status` field in the body of `AWAITING_FUNDS`.

⚠️ Please note that this response only indicates that the batch payment instruction has been received. 
The distribution of the batch to investors will not occur until the necessary funds are received. 

The response will include a payTo section. Payment should be sent to the bank details specified, including the `payTo.reference`.

Once payment has been made, the [`GET /transfers/batch/{batchId}`](/#payments-manager-get-transfers-batch-batchid) 
endpoint can be used to see the current status of the batch payment instruction.

The status of the money transfer is further broken down at a per investor level.
